File::FilterFuncs - specify filter functions for files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use File::FilterFuncs qw(filters);

 filters('source.txt',
     sub { uc $_ },
     'dest.txt'
 );

=head1 INTRODUCTION

C<File::FilterFuncs> makes it easy to perform transformations on
files. When you use this module, you specify a group of filter
functions that perform transformations on the lines in a source
file. Those transformed lines are written to the destination file
that you specify. For example, this code coverts an entire file
to upper-case, line-by-line:

 use File::FilterFuncs qw(filters);

 filters('source.txt',
     sub { uc $_ },
     'dest.txt'
 );

The entire source file is not read into memory. Instead it is
read one line at a time, and the destination file is written one
line at a time.

Just as Perl's concept of a line can be changed by
setting C<$/>, so the C<filters> function's idea of a line
can also be changed by specifying a value for C<$/> in
the call to C<filters>:

 my $pad = "\0" x 2;
 filters('source.dat',
    '$/' => 1022,
    sub { $_ . $pad },
    'dest.dat'
 );

Filter functions are invoked in the order in which they are seen.
This code upper-cases then puts inside parenthses every line in
'source.txt' and copies the output to 'dest.txt':

 filters ('source.txt',
    sub { uc $_ },
    sub { chomp $_; "($_)\n" },
    'dest.txt'
 );

The current line that is being worked on is in C<$_>. The return
value of each filter function is reassigned to C<$_> for the
benefit of the next filter function. 

The C<filters> subroutine expects its first argument to be the
name of the source file, and the last argument should be the name
of the destination file. The function C<filters> will C<die>
if either one of the file names is missing or if they are inaccessible.

If you need to actually filter using File::FilterFuncs :-) ,
you can call ignore_line() from within your filter function. This
program ignores any line that contains only whitespace:

  use File::FilterFuncs qw(filters ignore_line);

  my $func = sub {
      unless (/[^\s]/) {
          ignore_line();
          return;
      };
      $_;
  };

  filters('source.txt', $func, 'dest.txt');


=head1 OPTIONS

A few options determine how the C<filters> subroutine works.

=over

=item C<binmode>

C<Binmode> lets you specify a layer to be used for the input
data. For example, this will read a utf-8 file and write the data
using the default output layer:

 filters (
    'source.txt',
    binmode => ':utf8',
    'dest.txt',
 );

=item C<boutmode>

C<Boutmode> lets the programmer specify a layer to be used for
writing the output data. For example, this code on a Linux
platform should read text data using the Linux end-of-line format
and write it using the DOS (CRLF) end-of-line format:

 filters (
    'source.txt',
    boutmode => ':crlf',
    'dest.txt',
 );

=item C<$/>

Setting C<$/> lets you determine how an end-of-line is
recognized. Set this option to the same value that you would set
the C<$/> variable to in a program. For example, suppose a file
contains this:

  ABCDEFGHIJKL

The following program should write three letters at a time to the
output file:

 filters (
    'source.txt',
    '$/' => \3,
    sub { "$_\n" },
    'dest.txt',
 );

=head1 BUGS

The source and destination files cannot be the same. If the
source and destionation files have the same name and path,
C<filters> dies with an appropriate error message. If symbolic
or hard-linking is used to give the same file two
different names, the results are undefined.

This module is not thread-safe due to the use of
the package variable C<$ignore_line>.

Thanks go to Uri Guttman <uri [at] stemsystems.com> for several
helpful suggestions including enabling the slurp and paragraph
modes and dealing with filtering a file onto itself.

Andy <anedza [at] infotek-consulting.com> also commented on the
need to explain or simplify the use of the callback filter
functions.

=head1 TODO

=over

=item *

Allow file handles to be used for input and output.

=item *

Merge the functionalities of both line selection and line
transformation into a single callback subroutine.
