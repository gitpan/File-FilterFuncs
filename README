File-FilterFuncs version 0.53
=============================

File::FilterFuncs makes it easy to perform transformations on
files. When you use this module, you specify a group of filter
functions that perform transformations on the lines in a source
file. Those transformed lines are written to the destination file
that you specify. For example, this code coverts an entire file
to upper-case, line-by-line:

 use File::FilterFuncs qw(filters);

 filters('source.txt',
     sub { uc $_; 1 },
     'dest.txt'
 );

See the POD for more examples and details.
